- Hi! I'm Anna Koskinen.
- I'm studying biomedical engineering at TUNI. I started in 2021.
- I became interested in programming last spring and I'm currently studying more of it.
- I know Python and I'm currently learning C++.
- Here I have projects I have done in my programming courses. Python projects are from spring 2022 and C++ projects will be added here throughout this spring.
