- Hi! I'm Anna Koskinen.
- I'm studying biomedical engineering at TUNI. I started in 2021.
- I have chosen programming as my minor and it is currently my main interest.
- I know Python, C++, JavaScript and I'm currently learning Java.
- Here I have projects I have done in my programming courses. Python projects are from spring 2022 and other projects are added once completed.
